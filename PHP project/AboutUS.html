		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<p> The sight of hundreds of deserving young candidates denied education due to a limited number of good colleges caused a desire in the minds of some public-spirited people to open a first-grade college in the city, and that the college is called RAMAKRISHNA MISSION VIVEKANANDA COLLEGE, after the great patriot-monk and founder of the Ramakrishna Mission.</p><br>

		<p>On an auspicious day of 21st June 1946, Swami Kailashanandaji Maharaj, the then President of Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai ceremoniously inaugurated the College. On 1st July 1946, the Professor, Philosopher, and President of India-to-be, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan formally inaugurated the College and dedicated it to the cause of quality education.</p><br>

		<p>So, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College began its humble march with 20 teachers and 339 students with the prime motive of imparting man-making and character-building education and combining the principles of secular knowledge and spiritual knowledge.</p>
